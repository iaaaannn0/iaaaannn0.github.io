It provides a seamless workflow for managing dependencies, creating virtual environments, and packaging applications. This guide will walk you through the essential features of Poetry, including how to generate a requirements.txt file for compatibility with pip. 1. Installing Poetry To install Poetry, run the following command: 1curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - After installation, ensure Poetry is available in your terminal by checking its version: 1poetry --version If the command does not work, add Poetry to your PATH: 1export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot; 2. Creating a New Poetry Project To create a new Python project with Poetry, use: 1poetry new my_project This command sets up a basic Python package structure: 123456my_project/â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml # Configuration file for Poetryâ”œâ”€â”€ README.rstâ”œâ”€â”€ my_project/ # Project source codeâ”‚ â””â”€â”€ __init__.pyâ””â”€â”€ tests/ # Test files If you already have a project and want to initialize Poetry within it, navigate to the project directory and run: 1poetry init This will guide you through setting up pyproject.toml interactively. 3. Managing Dependencies Adding Dependencies To install a package and automatically update pyproject.toml and poetry.lock, use: 1poetry add requests For a development-only dependency: 1poetry add --dev pytest Removing Dependencies To remove a package: 1poetry remove requests Updating Dependencies To update all dependencies: 1poetry update To update a specific package: 1poetry update requests 4. Virtual Environments and Running Code Poetry automatically manages a virtual environment for your project. You can activate it with: 1poetry shell To run a Python script within the virtual environment without activating the shell: 1poetry run python script.py To check the virtual environment being used: 1poetry env info 5. Exporting Requirements for pip Poetry does not use requirements.txt natively, but you can export dependencies for environments that require it (e.g., Docker, CI/CD pipelines). 6. Install the Poetry Export Plugin Poetry 2.0+ requires an additional plugin to export dependencies: 1poetry self add poetry-plugin-export 7. Generate requirements.txt Run the following command to export dependencies: 1poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes If you need to include development dependencies: 1poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes --with dev You can then install these dependencies using pip: 1pip install -r requirements.txt 8. Version Management To check the current project version: 1poetry version To update the version: 123poetry version patch # Increases 1.0.0 -&gt; 1.0.1poetry version minor # Increases 1.0.0 -&gt; 1.1.0poetry version major # Increases 1.0.0 -&gt; 2.0.0 9. Publishing to PyPI To publish your package to PyPI, first build it: 1poetry build Then publish it: 1poetry publish To publish to TestPyPI for testing: 1poetry publish --repository testpypi Conclusion Poetry simplifies dependency management, virtual environments, and packaging for Python projects. By using Poetry, you can ensure a more reliable and consistent development workflow. With the ability to export requirements.txt, Poetry remains compatible with traditional Python workflows while providing a modern alternative to pip and virtualenv.
